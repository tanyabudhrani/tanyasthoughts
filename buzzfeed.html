        <p class="lead">Do you have pitch black hair? Enjoy perusing through a book once in a while? Would absolutely love to go on a girls trip with your “besties?” Then, congratulations! If you were a food, you would definitely be a good ol’ plate of alfredo pasta. Want to know what city you should live in? Or which character from ‘Euphoria’ perfectly embodies you? Why not scroll through the endless catalog of personality quizzes offered by the internet’s favorite news website, Buzzfeed.</p>
  
        <p>If you aren’t new to the internet and this isn’t the first article you’ve ever opened up, then, chances are, you’ve heard of Buzzfeed and their infamous personality quizzes that ask the most random questions to arrive at a seemingly heavy conclusion about you and your personality type. In fact, Buzzfeed quizzes are so popular that their <em>“What City Should You Actually Live In?”</em> quiz has over 18 million views and has been liked on Facebook approximately 2.5 million times. What is it that makes these quizzes so enticing to click on—when, in reality, they’re nothing more than a mediocre pastime? Might it be our overwhelming desire to know what type of bread we are? Perhaps it is our subconscious narcissism that squeals with joy each time we get compared to a famous celebrity. Or, maybe, we simply <em>'crave the peace of mind that comes from believing that the human condition is quantifiable (Maloney, 2014).'</em></p>
        <p>According to Sherry Turkle, an MIT psychologist, quizzes like these provide us with a sense of comfort.</p>
        <blockquote>
          They’ll [people] use a quiz to get the number. It gives people something to look at, an object to think with. I think these quizzes are a kind of focus for attention (Turkle, 2014).
        </blockquote>

        <p>And it doesn’t just stop at Buzzfeed; individuals everywhere have a tendency to introduce themselves based off of their internet quiz results. Take the Myers-Briggs Type Indicator for instance: whether you’re an INFJ, an INFP, or an ABCD, quizzes like these excel at snatching our attention and incentivizing us to answer over a hundred personality-based questions to get a grapple at who we might be.</p>

        <p>The idea of <em>‘knowing thyself’</em> has stumped millions of philosophers who have tried tirelessly to classify human nature into some type of pigeonhole; to try and simplify something so complex down to the minutiae—an impossible feat for anyone. Regardless, Buzzfeed was able to do just that. So was Myers-Briggs, and Caliper, the OPQ32, HEXACO, and many more. These quizzes have been used countless times in job interviews, psychology, and on the first day of classes when the guidance counselor comes to meet us. Yet, it begs the question, how can we trust an objective quiz made by subjective individuals? The truth is, we cannot. And, deep down, we know this. We know that these quizzes can’t possibly give us any sort of revelation on who we are because human nature is simply way too complicated for any internet quiz to understand. And yet, we still take the time out of our day to accomplish them. Why? Because we would much rather rely on an AI to figure us out rather than doing it ourselves.</p>

        <p>Since the dawn of the pandemic, two long years ago, our online personas have expanded considerably. Almost everything we used to be able to do in person can now be done online, which leaves room for us to get sucked into the never-ending trend of internet fads—another potential opportunity for us to change our entire look to fit in, ask ourselves who we actually want to be, then spiral down an existential dilemma that forces us to take an online trip to 16Personalities to ensure that we’re still an ENTP. While participating in internet culture isn’t necessarily a bad thing, it does play a key role in muddling with our “coming-of-age-finding-yourself-you-are-the-main-character” plans. What most of us tend to forget is that you ARE the main character of your own story, and you’re allowed to embark on whatever sort of journey you’d like to go on if it would help you be clear on who you want to be.</p>

        <p>At the end of the day, these quizzes are just the tip of our ‘complex personalities’ iceberg. Buzzfeed may call us a bowl of mashed potatoes today and a plate of Spaghetti-Os tomorrow. That doesn’t take away from the fact that we want to know ourselves—and if it must be through the type of food we are, then so be it. The process of understanding ourselves isn’t an overnight one. When it comes to finally embracing our uniqueness, we should enjoy the journey and remember that personality quizzes are just pit stops along the lengthy road to self-realization.</p>
