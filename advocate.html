        <p class="lead">Etched upon a stone arch above the gates of Hell, a decree commands: <em>'Abandon all hope, ye who enter here.'</em> Dante, confronted by these ominous words, feels a wave of apprehension engulf him, only to find solace in Virgil’s assurances that those who reside here are souls “steeped in sorrow” and bereft of “all intellectual good (Alighieri, 1320)”. Intriguingly, this same epigraph is also inscribed on the opening page of Bret Easton Ellis’ ‘American Psycho’ (Think Twice, 2018). The only difference here however, is that, one character is about to embark upon a harrowing descent through the depths of the underworld, while the other lounges in the backseat of a cab, clad in Armani, forced to listen to his colleague drabble on about the purported decline of New York and its rapid infestation of nazis, homosexuals, and gridlock. </p>
        <p>Not unlike Dante, Patrick Bateman, our malevolent protagonist, must also confront the evil surrounding him. He however, does so in a more peculiar manner; opting instead to rid the world of immorality using kitchen knives, chainsaws, axes, and nail guns. That being said, perhaps a comparison to Dante Aligheri may be illogical– while Dante’s character is cowardly and reluctant, Bateman’s is sinister and unapologetic (Kooijman and Laine, 2003). In fact, the latter’s constant fixation on thoughts of violence and death draws a more striking parallel to Lucifer himself. This essay will explore Patrick Bateman as a caricature of the Devil in Religious literature. </p>

          <h2>The mask of deception </h2>
          <p>In the Scriptures, the devil is portrayed as a responsible servant and an angelic host; revered by other angels for his wisdom (Orlov, 2012). However, despite his influence and position, he was never quite satisfied– Isaiah 14:12-15 reveals the devil’s inner thoughts as he says to himself, <em>'I will ascend to heaven; above the stars of God I will set my throne on high; I will sit on the mount of assembly in the far reaches of the north (The Holy Bible: Containing the Old and New Testaments Translated out of the Original Tongues and with the Former Translations Diligently Compared & Revised, 1986).'</em> His insatiable need for power is only worsened after God anoints his only begotten son as the new 'Messiah,' entreating all heavenly beings to now bow before his child. Fueled by jealousy, Lucifer denies his creator and seals his doom; forcing God to cast him out of paradise. Despite being <em>'of the first, / If not the first Archangel, great in Power, / In favor and preeminence (Milton, 1667),'</em> Lucifer always held decrepit thoughts, masked only by his beauty. Comparatively, Bateman too was held in high regard amongst the settlers of New York. His coworkers, similar to the angels, frequently looked to Bateman for advice on material possessions and dinner plans. From the trendiest restaurant in the Zagat guide to the best way to wear tassel loafers; Patrick had an opinion on everything, including the best way to enucleate a person’s eyeball (Fazio). However, his similarities to the devil go way beyond just his depraved mind and charming facade; Bateman was also constantly infected by the green-eyed monster. </p>
          <p>Many know ‘American Psycho’ by the infamous card scene in the film. As four men sit around a conference table, each one takes turns pulling out their business cards to compare. Going first was Patrick’s big mistake; his off-white card with its embossments is easily overshadowed by the eggshell color of Van Patten’s, the raised lettering of Bryce’s, and the “tasteful thickness” of Paul Allen’s (Norton, 2021). However, despite the apparent differences, a side-by-side would reveal that all the cards are exactly alike: white, with black lettering, name and position aligned in the middle. And yet, each procurement of the next person’s card drives Bateman into more of a frenzy. His resentment towards his colleagues mirrors Lucifer’s jealousy of not being the “most high” (Ebens, 2015).– unwarranted and debilitating. It is through this that both individuals further isolate themselves from those around them. Lucifer with his fall from grace and Bateman with his inexorable descent into madness and paranoia (Fredriksson).  </p>
          <p>In Dante’s Inferno, the devil is portrayed as a monstrous figure trapped at the center of Hell (Aligheri, 1320). Without his false colors, Lucifer is depicted as a giant, grotesque figure with three faces. One significant aspect of the way Dante writes Lucifer is of him not being an active ruler of hell but rather a passive figure, frozen in a state of perpetual suffering (Roberts and Belknap, 2023). He lost his looks, his position, and his reverence. In comparison, while Bateman’s character typically maintains his cool throughout the novel, there are instances that readers are able to notice his inner turmoil and instability. One notable example occurs during Bateman’s encounters with Paul Owen. As the story progresses, Bateman becomes increasingly more obsessed with Owen, despite the latter’s inability to even remember Patrick’s name. As the mask slips, the facade of control begins to dissipate. However, in contrast to Lucifer who is eternally damned in a frozen lake, nine-layers underground, Bateman’s suffering is psychological and ultimately self-destructive, which he elucidates in a chapter about summer: <em>'My nightly bloodlust has overflown into my days. I feel lethal, on the verge of frenzy. I think my mask of sanity is about to slip (Bret Easton Ellis, 1991).'</em></p>

          <h2>Hell is other people</h2>
          <p>At the mention of hell, most minds would instinctively drift to the classic depiction often taught in most religion classes– lakes of fire, whips and chains, and stench of death. However, Jean Paul Sartre offers a different view: “Hell is other people.” Sartre’s existentialist perspective challenges traditional notions of hell as a physical place of punishment, suggesting instead that it is the subjective experience of being trapped in the judgements and expectations of others (Mahdi, 2020). </p>
          <p>By that idea, it is easy to see how Bateman is ensnared in his own hell, constantly plagued by the pressures of conformity and societal expectations. While jealousy is one of the main catalysts for Bateman’s antagonism, jealousy would not exist without people to be jealous of. In the card scene, each businessman is a successful twentysomething in a designer suit, and are somehow all vice presidents of Pierce and Pierce (Elliott, 2018). In fact, Paul Owen’s blunder of confusing Patrick Bateman for Marcus Halberstram is not all that far fetched– The former even remarks how the mistake seems logical because <em>'Marcus also works at P&P and in fact does the same exact thing I do and he also has a penchant for Valentino Suits (Mercier, 2014).'</em> Sartre argues that the presence of others inherently affects our world in ways in which we cannot control. Bateman is constantly surrounded by peers who are essentially interchangeable, which force him into a struggle to try and assert his own identity, leading to his competitive and envious nature. </p>
          <p>Furthermore, Sartre’s assertions take on a particularly sinister resonance in the context of Patrick’s relationships. Despite his outward charisma, he is unable to form genuine emotional connections with others. Upon meeting his colleagues, Bateman typically goes on lengthy tangents describing every aspect of their outfit choice; from the make of their suit to the brand of their socks. These meticulous descriptions reveal Patrick’s obsession with image– “being seen in the right place, with the right people, looking the right way (Elliot, 2018).” Though exaggerated, Bret Easton Ellis utilizes Patrick’s character as a depiction of the shallowness of a young urban professional in the 1980s, whose self-esteem is directly correlated to monetary value and materialism (Rischard, 2020). </p>
          <p>Despite Bateman’s irrational scrutiny of those around him, his friends are not all that dissimilar; the big apple overrun by depraved hedonists who cannot see past their own ‘Oliver Peoples glasses (Rapp et al, 2017).’ For instance, after Bateman murders Paul Allen, he is stopped by his colleague, Luis Carruthers who, instead of asking Patrick what he is doing, is more focused on the brand of the duffel bag Patrick had stuffed Paul’s body into (Ahmed, 2023). Self-involvement is a recurring theme throughout the story, one that drives Patrick to admit his wrongdoings in an effort to stand out, yet his confessions fall on deaf ears, placing him in his own personal hell where he will never be unique.  </p>
          <p>In contrast, while Bateman is pushed to the brink of evil due to the masses and their lack of awareness, Satan does so because of one person: the Messiah. As described by John Milton, in ‘Paradise Lost,’ Satan is  “fraught / with envy against the Son of God (Johnson, 2013).” It is because of this new character in Satan’s life that he drives himself mad with desire. The appearance of the anointed One, along with Heaven’s assent in accepting Jesus as second in command, prompts Satan to act out on his thoughts and stage a coup against his creator.  </p>
          <p>Bateman is placed in hell because he thrives on nothing but validation, yet can never receive it. Satan is placed in hell because he rejects the ultimate validation of his creator (Williams, 2024). This comparison proves that one’s ideas of hell may vary from individual to individual– it could mean sacrilege to the contemporary dramatist, a frozen lake, nine layers underground, to the medieval poet, or the bustling avenues of Wall Street to the twentieth-century novelist (Birds and Books, 2019). In essence, the parallels between the two characters serve to highlight the trappings of wealth and power. Despite Bateman’s privileged lifestyle and Lucifer’s high position, the two were still filled with the desire to commit increasingly heinous acts in a futile attempt to prove their own self-worth (Powell et al, 2021). </p>

         <h2>Faux indifference </h2>
         <p>At the beginning of the film, our protagonist is introduced through his infamous monologue. Bateman walks the audience through his laborious skin care routine while recounting his avid dissociation from reality as he says, <em>'and though I can hide my cold gaze, and you can shake my hand and feel flesh gripping yours, and maybe you can even sense our lifestyles are probably comparable, I simply am not there (Ellis, 1991).'</em> The scene itself serves as a paradox– while insisting on his detachment from society, Patrick still takes great pains to make himself presentable to it; with the use of ice packs and deep pore cleanser lotions (Biggs, 2020). Having an Id that thrives on attention and superficiality, Bateman is unable to quench his innate desire for validation. He perceives himself as incomparable to those around him, and yet he still strives for their compliments (James & Xandra Harbet, 2017). </p>
          <p> Throughout the movie, Bateman is seen fishing for any sort of reaction from the monotony surrounding him, yet his attempts are often met with little to no response. Take the bar scene for instance– in a brief confession, Patrick admits to a model that he works in “murders and executions” as opposed to “mergers and acquisitions,” but the model does not even bat an eye (Biggs, 2020). The fact that Bateman is never caught, despite his recklessness, is a true testament to the pervasive indifference that permeates through yuppie culture (Robinson, 2019). It is easy to pass off Bateman’s aggression as the symptoms for psychosis, however a closer look would reveal his underlying cries for recognition in a world that has turned a blind eye to the suffering of others. Even at the end of his monologue, he realizes his admissions will always be futile and no matter what he does or whom he kills, he will never excel above his peers and be seen as his own person: <em>'There has been no reason for me to tell you any of this. This confession has meant nothing… (James & Xandra Harbet, 2017).'</em></p>
          <p>Comparatively, a proper understanding behind Satan’s motives would explain his transition from all good to pure evil. Constricted by the hierarchy of God and His Son, Satan attempts to elevate himself above his peers (Jacobs, 2024). In doing so however, he manipulates the natural order set in place by his Creator, leading to his ultimate downfall. And, while he is fueled by jealousy, Satan does reflect on his wrongdoings from time to time. For instance, in Book Four of Paradise Lost, as Satan addresses his followers, he begins to weep; coming close to repentance. However, just as Bateman shuts the door on his own vulnerability, Satan too turns around and cuts off any thoughts of remorse (Johnson, 2013). This inner conflict between his pride and his underlying awareness of his wrongdoings mirrors that of Bateman and his inner turmoil. Despite their outward displays of indifference, both characters grapple with a profound sense of insecurity and an insatiable desire for individuality.</p>

          <h2>Conclusion</h2>
          <p>Draped above the mantle of Harry’s bar is a red sign that reads <em>'THIS IS NOT AN EXIT.'</em> The novel ends here– leaving readers suspended in a state of uncertainty, akin to the ambiguity of Bateman himself. The beauty of Bret Easton Ellis’ narrative lies in its refusal to offer easy answers or neatly tie up loose ends. This deliberate distance placed between the protagonist and the audience invites the latter to observe Bateman from a detached perspective; as an individual full of malice, yet also self-aware of his own insanity. </p>
          <p>Alternatively, the film adaptation presents a slightly different conclusion. As Bateman gazes into the abyss, he admits that he has surpassed the mayhem he had once wrought; recognizing the evil behind his actions. And, against this backdrop of moral nihilism, a glaring EXIT sign looms in the background, starkly contrasted with the ominous warning in the book. </p>
          <p>This juxtaposition leaves Bateman’s fate open to interpretation. The presence of the EXIT and NO EXIT signs serves as a symbolic representation of either an opportunity for escape from his own personal hell or the warning hints at the possibility that he may be forever trapped in a fate not unlike that of the Devil. Except, while Satan is imprisoned in a lake of ice, our protagonist lives deep in the bastions of New York’s elite; destined to live, one hand on the trigger, the other on the Zagat guide. </p>
